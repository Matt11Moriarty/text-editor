# Text-Editor App

## Description

As an aspiring developer, I wanted an application that I can write code in and use offline for practicing my skills so I build this application for just such a purpose.
In building this text editor, my understanding of progressive web apps and the methodologies involved has grown, and I feel confident in creating these in the future!
